          <p class="p2">My own experience at the Cup was one of personal growth and discovery, as I participated in the sports event.
          The Lux Mundis Cup was more than just an event; it was a powerful testament to the college's commitment to fostering well-rounded individuals. 
          It wasn't just about winning or losing; it was about growth, discovery, and the celebration of knowledge, talent, and collaborative spirit.</p>

          <p class="p3">  It was a reminder that education isn't confined to textbooks or lectures; it's a vibrant, dynamic process that involves teamwork, creativity,
          and a willingness to push boundaries. The memories I made, the friendships I forged, and the personal growth I experienced during the Lux Mundis Cup are invaluable.</p>
